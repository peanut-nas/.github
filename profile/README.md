# Welcome to the team 🙌

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

### 🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
- This organization mainly provides a NAS system based on general operating systems (Windows, Linux, MacOS).
### 👀 Contribution guidelines - how do team members dive in?
- To dive into the team and contribute effectively, a strong interest in NAS systems is required. It is also recommended to establish a connection with me to better understand the team's goals and direction. Feel free to ask any further questions or if you need assistance at any time.
